              This depends on the pricing plan that you select. If you go for
              the “Unlimited kms” pricing plans (available only without fuel,
              and only for bookings whose duration is more than 24 hours), there
              is absolutely no limit to the kilometres that you can drive, and
              you have complete flexibility of driving the car as much as you
              want. Revv it up! Other pricing plans have a "Kilometres limit",
              which varies based on the plan selected. You can still drive
              beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked
              will attract an additional charge.

              All of our cars are equipped with an All India Tourist Permit, so

              in the country, after paying the inter-state taxes at the state
              borders. However, we do not permit taking Revv vehicles to
              Leh/Ladakh region, Kaza/Nako region and spiti valley. We also

              the state borders are to be paid and borne by the customer. Our
              cars are equipped with Fast tag devices for your convenience. The

              This depends on the pricing plan that you select. If you go for
              the “Unlimited kms” pricing plans (available only without fuel,
              and only for bookings whose duration is more than 24 hours), there
              is absolutely no limit to the kilometres that you can drive, and
              you have complete flexibility of driving the car as much as you
              want. Revv it up! Other pricing plans have a "Kilometres limit",
              which varies based on the plan selected. You can still drive
              beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked
              will attract an additional charge.

              All of our cars are equipped with an All India Tourist Permit, so
              you are free to drive anywhere in the country. All India Tourist
              Permit means that the car is legally permitted to ply in any state
              in the country, after paying the inter-state taxes at the state
              borders. However, we do not permit taking Revv vehicles to
              Leh/Ladakh region, Kaza/Nako region and spiti valley. We also
              advise you to avoid bad terrains (especially in non- SUV cars) and
              areas affected by civil unrest. Please note: Interstate taxes at
              the state borders are to be paid and borne by the customer. Our
              cars are equipped with Fast tag devices for your convenience. The
